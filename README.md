# Group02-Online Electronics Store

## Introduction
We choosed to build a Online Electronics Store for our Distributed Systems project. Our project was build on the Microservices Architecture, with Node.js as the primary technology. The architecture aims to provide a scalable and modular system by breaking down the application into smaller, independent services. The main microservices implemented are customer, product, and order, with an added user authentication system to ensure secure access to the platform.

## Architecture
The architecture follows a microservices approach, where the application is divided into smaller, self-contained services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This promotes flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance of the system. Each microservice handles a specific domain (customer, product, order) and has its own data storage, business logic, and API endpoints.

## Micro-services


● The implementation methods used (Netflix software stack)

## Core services


● Describe about each microservice and its functionality for the system.
● The REST API exposed by the microservice
● Inter-service interactions happened via the micro-service

## Discovery Server
We used the inbuilt discovery server of Node.js for out project.

## API Gateway
We used the inbuit API Gateway of Express for our project.

## User Interface
We used Postman to access the services provided by our Online Electronic Store's API. Postman was also used Postman during the testing phase to test the functionality of the services provided by each micro service.

## Deployment
● Suggest a method to deploy the system to use in production.
